# UnityProjectDemo
A simple project for introducing teens to Unity, where they learn how to make a simple 2D platformer, starring Cubey. 
Teens will have to make the project themselves in the CREATEYOURGAMEHERE scene and make the scripts/assets themselves.

Teens shouldn't upload their games made with this tutorial to Itch.io as Public, they should only save them as Drafts
so they can learn how to upload their future game projects to the Itch.io platform.
